# credit_risk_Prediction
This project aims to develop a Credit Risk Prediction system that determines whether a loan applicant is likely to repay the loan or default. Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults, so accurately predicting credit risk is crucial for minimizing financial risk and improving decision-making.
